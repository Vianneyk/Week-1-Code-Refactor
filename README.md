In this repository, I had to recreate a functioning webpage by amending and testing HTML and CSS files given to me by my instructor. to make sure the webpage met accessibility standards, I made sure the elements followed a logical structure, added missing imaged alt attributes and links. I also had to tidy up the codes by adding semantic HTML elements.
